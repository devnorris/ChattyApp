# Chatty App
Chatty App is a single page messenger app that allows users to communicate with eachother in real time. There is no login required but you are able to change your name if desired, or be known as Anonymous. You are assigned a random color when you connect to the app. Also it displays the number of users connected in the top right corner.

This was created with React for front end work and uses WebSockets for the server side.
